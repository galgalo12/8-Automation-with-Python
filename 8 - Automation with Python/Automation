#Scenario

#You are a security professional working at a health care company.
#As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. 
#The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. 
#Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. 
#There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. 
#There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

#Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified 
#on the remove list.If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

#Import and Read the File Contents


        # import the file 
        import_file = "allow_list.txt"
        # Open the file
        with open(import_file, "r") as file: 
            ip_addresses = file.read()
        # display the ip_addresses
        print(ip_addresses)

# There are 17 IP addressess in this String.
